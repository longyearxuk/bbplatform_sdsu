  ```

## 1/ Running tips
- 1.1. Start a simulation  

  - (1) Preparations: install gfortran compiler

  - (2) Check and compile the bbplatform codes:  
    ```
    cd BB_code_multi0503
    csh compile.sh
    cp BBtoolbox-newrl-rupspeed-new-randomiseed.exe ~/YOUR/RUNNING/DIRECTORY/.
    ```

  - (3) Check and modify the input/output paths
    * [in 2.3-(1): testDATE.bbpar]
    ```
    - /* OUTPUT DIRECTORY */
    - /* VELOCITY MODEL FILE */
    - /* STATIONS FILE */
    - /* 2ND STATIONS FILE */ (*.dat, optional)
    - /* EXTENDED FAULT-MODEL FILE */
    - /* SCATTERING PARAMETERS FILE */
    - /* SRF FILE */
    - /* CORRELATION FILES */ (*.bin, optional)
    ```
    
    * [in 2.2-(2): /* STATIONS FILE */]
    ```
    - /* INPUT DIRECTORY */ (for input LF results)
    ```

    * [in 2.2-(3): change input LF formats]
    ```
    python3 LF_cm2m.py
    ```

  - (4) Run code and provide the .bbpar file
    ```
    cd  ~/YOUR/RUNNING/DIRECTORY/.
    ulimit -s unlimited		# maximum stack size
    ulimit -u unlimited		# maximum user process
    # to avoid limit for ray-tracing (segmentation fault)#
    ./BBtoolbox-newrl-rupspeed-new-randomiseed.exe
    [keyboard input: testDATE.bbpar]
    ```

  - (5) Post-processing: observations
    * Modify and run BBs_obs_conv_NE.m & BBs_obs_rd50_kxu.m
      (Not needed when observation rd50's are provided)

  - (6) Post-processing: comparisons
    * Modify and run BBs_hyb_rd50_kxu.m
    ```
    cd mtools
    # transfer hyb results into rd50
    # modify:
    # EVENTsdo, METHODsdo (current simulation)
    # EVEpath, BBdir (paths to output files)
    # rls, rlz (start & number of realizations)
    # STATs (all the observation stations)
    matlab -nodisplay
    BBs_hyb_rd50_kxu
    ```

    * Modify and run BBs_GOFplot_kxu.m
    ```
    cd mtools
    # plot GOF for rd50 with observations
    # modify:
    # EVENTs, METHODs (current simulation)
    # EVEpath, BBdir (paths to output files)
    # DATAdir, DDIR (paths to observation data)
    # PLTdir (path to output figures)
    # do_rlz (total number of realizations)
    # STATs (all the observation stations)
    #
    # !! Check 90:95 for the correct input file names and formats !!
    #
    matlab -nodisplay
    BBs_GOFplot_kxu
    ```

- 1.2. Notes on realizations

  - (1) Changes made for realizations:  
    * iseed & cseed [in 2.2-(1) scattering.dat].  

    * seed value in SRC files [not included in bbplatform].  
    ```
    # SRC files are used by GP rupture generator & LF simulations
    # SRC files determine:
    # /* rake */ in .bbpar file
    # rupture speed and slip distributions in SRF file
    # difference in extened_fault file
    # difference in LF simulations
    ```

    * other param/data files remain unchanged.  
      (.bbpar, bbtstations.dat, vmod.txt, observation data)

- 1.3. Notes on parameter tests

  - (1) Changes in 'Vrup' (rupture speed)
    [2.1-(2): composition.f90: 670-680] Vrup_ratio determination  
    [2.1-(2): composition.f90: 809-816] Vrup GP corrections  

  - (2) Changes in 'fac' (scaling factor)
    [2.1-(2): module_bbtoolbox.f90: 383-385]
