for V1.5.5.3 (02/05/2015)

This version is sent to Fabio on 02/16/2015.

Updated
<composition.f90>
bug fixed for sdec computation (01/14/2015).
from
   sdec=1.10 for R_cell(k) > 200km.
to
   sdec=1.10 for R_cell(k) > 160km.
This does not affect on Mineral, but affect on Saguenay?

<source.f90>
New rc for CENA (02/06/2015).
Compute a new str_fac in srf_read with dtop (Ztor) (02/11/2015).

bug fixed bc for CENA (02/14/2015).
bc=( 0.141-0.090*atan(Mw*1.60-9.55) )*alt, added "*alt".

Add tapering for stf using Tr (02/16/2015).

<scattering.dat file>
New scatterin.dat file -> scattering.dat.v1553.
Recommended decimation factor is 4 rather than 3.

<scattering.f90>
In a new scattering.dat (scattering.dat.v1553 file),
If str_fac=0.0 then
   if gs_flag = 1, str_fac=50e6
   if gs_flag = 2, str_fac=(225+16*Ztor)e6. ... computed in srf_read in source.f90

If str_fac is real number, user-defined (02/10/2015). 

<io.f90>
In read_seis,
change from:
! Initial condition test to check wheter LF or optional HF are going to be opened
to:
! Make clear which parameters are used for the file format

This was changed in v156_f95, but was not changed in v156 nor v1552.
This should be in v156 and v1552.
This is changed in v1553 (02/19/2015).



!----------------------

for V1.5.5.2,
Combine v1.5.5.1 to V1.5.6 (12/15/2014)

V1.5.6 is a version debugging V155 using
/opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/046/bin/intel64/ifort -check -traceback  $MODULE $CODE -o BBtoolboxV155-ifort.exe
done by April 2014.

V1.5.6 does not contain the change in v1551 (mostly for CENA).
The codes in this directory (V1.5.5.2) contain both v1551 and v156 (debugging then minor change).

<io.f90>
Add dpt=0 for "!compute average Vs, rho over fault" routine.
Make clear about ierr for opening file1d in vel1d subroutine.
Add using adgustment tmp_lf_len for BIN in read_seis, and
change using d_npts and tmp_dt for output bin files in write_disk.


<coda.f90>
Check i in t(i) must be ncoda or less than ncoda in coda subroutine.
Add "if (n1 .gt. ncoda) n1=ncoda" to check if n1 becomes greater than ncoda for p(n1).

<< TEST HISTORY for V1552 >>

<source.f90>
test rc for CENA with
rc=(0.185-0.120*atan(i*1.85-9.000))*alt (12/16/2014).
 
<coda.f90>
kappa_local=kappa(station)*0.5
to
kappa_local=kappa(station)*1.0
to see what effect it has on HFs (12/19/2014).
--->>> keep kappa_local=kappa(station)*0.5/

<coda.f90>
kappa1=0.005, 0.007
fc=30hz
if f > fc, exp(-(f-fc)*kappa1*log(Mw)) (12/22/2014).
--->>> all HFs (not only f>30hz) over-predicted ... wrong...

<composition.f90>
the same test above, but the exp is on Am_hf? (12/23/2014)
--->>> do not use kappa1

<composition.f90>
bug fixed for sdec computation (01/14/2015).
sdec=1.10 for R_cell(k) > 160km, but
sdec=1.10 for R_cell(k) > 200km.
This does not affect on Mineral, but affect on Saguenay?

!------------------------------

for v1.5.5.1 (09/26/2014)

This version was copied from v1.5.5.
Mainly changed for CENA events and CENA scenarios.
There is no change for western NA.

For CENA
<scattering.dat.v1551>
kappa = 0.017
str_fac = 6.25*(depth_to_top_of_fault)+265, rather than 350e06.
   RDL: 341e06
   Mineral: 301e06
   Saguenay: 399e06

<main_bbtoolbox.f90>
give station parameter for call sta_stf,
changing from 'call sta_stf' to 'call sta_stf(station)'.

<module_bbtoolbox.f90>
add sr_rrup computed in geometry.f90 and used in source.f90.

<geometry.f90>
add sr_rrup(n_stat) computation as Rrup between station to
extended fault.

<source.f90>
add Tr_fac computation for eastern North America.
There are two Tr_fac computations, for western CA and eastern North America.

<composition.f90>
change sdec factor for CENA,
changing R^1.1 for R > 200km to R > 160km.

<< source.f90 >>
small change Tr_fac computation.
original source.f90 is in source.old.v1551.
transit from rc to bc is changed from 70km < Rrup < 110km
to 100km < Rrup < 120km.
Also Tr_fac=bc for Rrup>120km (10/14/2014).

!<io.f90>
!for Jeff's NGAE-OCT14 exercise.
!changing targ_fr (merging frequency) to be 1Hz for all Mw (10/31/2014). <--- just for test (12/04/2014)

!------------------
TEST in v1.5.5
<source.f90>
test for a new Tr_fac
if distance > distmin (100km?)
the Tr_fac is Mw & distance dependent (mainly for eastern events)
(Sep 19 2014).



!!!!!!!! MEMO !!!!!!!!!!!!

in read_seis in io.f90,
   ! reading file... compute also time-step 
   do j=1,wts_npts
      read(1,*) dummy,tmp_timeseries(j,1),tmp_timeseries(j,2),tmp_timeseries(j,3)
      if (j == 2) ts_dt=dummy
   enddo

The code assumes that LFs must start from 0.0 sec, dt*1 sec, dt*2 sec .... .
If LFs start from dt*1 sec, the ts_dt should be dt*2 sec.
The ts_dt must be computed from dummy(2) - dummy(1) or so.
(July 8 2014)








for v1.5.5
This version is copied from srcV1.5.4.1_march2014 (04/15/2014).
Sent to Fabio on 04/16/2014, for SSA April 2014.
Change scattergram size setting in coda.f90.
(Actually change lf-length and the timeseries if needed.)
In the v1.5.4.1, 
in scoda, calling four1d caused Segmentation fault in the cruster server.
When "reshape" scattgram, the size of scattgram is too large to compute.
If lf-length > 102.375 sec, compute scattgram in size of 102.375 sec, and
add zero-pad to fill the rest of the lf-length.   
this only works when the LFs length is 102.3750 sec x n, an integer factor of 102.375 sec.
Tottori (new srf) and Niigata, their LF-lengths are 199.975 sec which the LF-length
add some anomaly at the end of the BBsynthetics.
When LF-length > 102.375 sec, add zero-pad to be that the LF-length = 102.375 x n.
For example, for the Tottori and Niigata, add zero-pad from 200.00sec to 204.750 sec,
102.375 sec x 2.
!!! THIS CHANGE IS ONLY FOR CASE'3SF' IN V1.5.5 !!!

<io.f90>
add lf-length adjustment for CASE ('3SF') (04/15/2014).

<coda1.f90>
<composition1.f90>
<convolution1.f90>
<io.f90>
<source1.f90>
<module_bbtoolbox1.f90>
tmp_npts amd tmp_lf_len are in tmp_para in module_bbtoolbox1.f90 (04/16/2014).

<composition1.f90>
change c0 for f0 computation (G&P-2010, eqn 13) for CEUS, c0=1.1 (when gs_flag=2).
change sdec computation when gs_flag=2 (CEUS events) (04/16/2014).

These *1.f90 files become *.f90 for v155, and old ones are in *.v1541.

Add recommendation in scattering.dat.v155.
str_fac = 50e6 for western CA, 350e6 for eastern north america (depth_independent),
and str_fac = 6.25*(depth_to_top_of_fault)+265 for eastern north america (depth_dependent).
From the depth_dependent str_fac, Saguenay-str_fac=399bar=6.25*21.5+265 -> 399e6,
Mineral-str_fac=302e6, and RDL-str_fac=342e6.


Modify filter the low frequency routine in coda.f90 (June 2014).

(Rob Graves uses 1.1 for CENA events, rather than the 2.1 for the west) (04/14/2014).
And in addition to doing this 
this test with the sdec values that we have defined for the eastern events, 
also estimate optimal str_fac values using sdec=1. for R<200 km, 
and sdec=1.1 for R>200 km. (04/15/2014, from Dr. Olsen)

to determine whether western CA events or eastern North America (ENA*1)  events,
and sdec parameter to adjust distance dependent"G" for ENA events (03/05/2014).
   *1: ENA: eastern North America (the southeastern Canada/northeastern U.S. region
      by G. M. Atkinson, Evaluation of Attenuation Models for the Northeastern United States/
      Southeastern Canada, Seismological Research Letters Vol83 No1 2012.

To send Fabio for BBPlatform, module_bbtoolbox.f90, scattering.f90 and composition.f90

!-------------- from srcV1.5.2_new_npts_idec ----------------

This version is copied from srcV1.5.2_new_npts (10/10/2013).

this code was sent to Fabio on 10/11/2013.

Previously tested in V1.5.3, composition6.f90 and io6.f90 (9/13/2013).

in the future...?
Making the decimation factor as input parameter, e.g., idec=3 will decimate by
a factor of three.
Need to modify scattering.dat that idec is a new input parameter.


!--------------- from srcV1.5.2_new_npts -----------------------------------------

This tells version information for srcV1.5.2 but including some update (8/27/2013). 
Fix (10/04/2013).

This version is modefied srcV1.5.2 for SWUS forward simulation California events.
In the BBPlatform validation runs, the data are set by npts=4096 and dt=0.025sec
for Plan A (LOMAP, Landers, North Palm Springs, Northridge, Whittier Narrows and
Tottori) and for Plan B (GMPEs).
For the next step, SWUS forward simulation uses LFs with npts=4096 but dt=0.1sec
that the longer lf_length caused "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" on the cluster
server.
We suggeted to Fabio to reduce the lf_length from 409.5 sec to 324.9 sec,
but the computed BBsynthetics were different because of different dt,
### 0.00312 sec for lf_length=409.5 sec and 0.005 sec for lf_length=324.9 sec. <- NG
0.00312 sec for lf_length=324.9 sec and 0.005 sec for lf_length=409.5 sec.     <- OK
Since the Plan A (exception of Niigata scenario) and Plan B use LFs, 
lf_length=102.4 sec and dt=0.00312 sec, this version sets dt=0.00312 sec 
when npts computed by sampling_check subroutine in interpolation.f90 is larger than
32768.
This version only works for California events, but does not work for Niigata event.
We will fix the problem in the next version.

<coda.f90>
This code computes scatterograms.
First, the scatterograms are computed with npts=32768 and lf_len=102.3750 sec.
If actual npts > 32768, add '0' in 32769 to the actual npts.

<composition1.f90>
"df" is always calculated by df = 1/(32768*0.00312sec).

<interpolation.f90>
Interpolation of LFs in sampling_check subroutine.
"dt_interp" = 102.3750 sec / (32768 - 1).
Note: The sampling_check is also used for user-defined stf in source1.f90, but
this version ignores usage of the user-defined stf.

<source1.f90>
dt = 102.375 sec / (32768 - 1).
"call MomRateFunct(dt)" is comment-outed.





!--------- from srcV1.5.2 ----------------------------------------------------
This tells version information for srcV1.5.2.
Copied from srcV1.5.1 on 5/7/2013 right after sending srcV1.5.1 to Fabio.

We send composition1.f90 and source1.f90 as srcV1.5.2 to Fabio as the final change 
for June meeting (5/10/2013).

<composition1.f90>
add header memo about tapering, back to the old version tapering (5/7/2013)

<source1.f90>

change to new Tr_factor calculation depending on Mw, do not use Tr_sca from scattering.dat.
we tested for better n for stf=(t**0.5) / (1 + (t/(t1))**n), but we chose n=2.0
as final change to send Fabio (5/10/2013).

<convolution2.f90> ... no change from srcV1.4.2.2_OLSEN
   change taper_len from nint(npts*0.5) to nint(10.0/dt),
   the same change as source2.f90
   
<io.f90>
   add reading Qp and Qs from a new formatting 1D velocity model file.
   the depth, vp, vs, rh, Qp and Qs are read by source.f90 and/or composition.f90. 
   also added routines, compute layer thickness,compute average Vs & rho over fault,
   and compute quarter-wavelength impedance effects (Boore and Joyner, BSSA 1997).

<module_bbtoolbox2.f90>
   in scattering, new parameters of imerg, fmax, str_fac, fac, afac and bfac are added
   to be read in a new form of scattering.dat.
   Fmax is set in a scattering.dat as well.

<scattering2.f90>
   adding scattering.dat parameters reading routines 
   for fmax,imerg, str_fac,fac,afac and bfac

<source3.f90>
   add srf_read subroutine to read srf to obtain subfault informations
   used in acc_spec in composition.f90
